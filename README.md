# Marketplace Monitor
Python script that automatically buy the item from Warface Marketplace for you when its price is within your budget.

# Requisites
- Python
- Python `requests` module
- Python `json` module
- Python `signal` module
- Python `getpass` module
- Python `steam` module
- Python `collections` module
- Python `IO` module
- Python `lxml` module
- 3 minutes to config
- Brain

# How
Since Warface devs are extraordinarily retarded that they put all skins in same series under the same name, you will need to find out the item_id in order to buy skins. I will publish a list of item-item_id later.

I will not explain how to set up python environment on your computer, there are plenty of materials so feel free to google it, then start the script and leave it running.
